There was a boy named Jamie down the street.
He liked to eat and liked to go to sleep.
He ballooned up in size.
Couldn't fit on his bike.
I think he needs to work on his physique.

He went to the gym with a protein shake.
Did a deadlift his back started to ache.
So he walked on the 'mill.
For just under a kil'.
Then decided to go out for steak.

To the restaurant he did waddle.
But over a hill he fumbled his bottle.
With his spriit quite low.
His confidence taking every blow.
He shuffled his way to McDonald.
